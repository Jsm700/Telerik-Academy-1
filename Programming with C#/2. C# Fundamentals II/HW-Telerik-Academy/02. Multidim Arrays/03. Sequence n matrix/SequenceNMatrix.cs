/*Problem 3. Sequence n matrix
We are given a matrix of strings of size N x M. Sequences in the matrix we define as sets of several neighbour elements located on the same line, column or diagonal.
Write a program that finds the longest sequence of equal strings in the matrix.
Example:

matrix	                result		 ||   matrix	         result
ha	fifi    ho	hi      ha, ha, ha   ||   s	    qq	s        s, s, s
fo	 ha	    hi	xx                   ||   pp	pp	s
xxx	 ho	    ha	xx                   ||   pp	qq	s
